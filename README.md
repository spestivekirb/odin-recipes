## Overview
This project is part of The Odin Project's foundations course, and is the sole project in the HTML section.
I will have demonstrated mastery of HTML upon completion.

## Reflection
This project was great practice for the various html tags and elements I have learned so far. It was also a good introduction to writing git commit messages and developing good git habits.
